// LIBRARIES
-- Reusuable code; things that have already been written. There's libraries for all coding languages
-- look at documentation! READMES, start here, do this
- 6 hours of bashing your head on a wall could be saved by reading 5 minutes of the documentation
- linking it, downloading them or installing them
-- npm installs and implementing into your project

- Bootstrap!
- jQuery
- AOS Animate On Scroll Library
- anime
- D3 data analytics
- toastify; gives you instant feedback, like a pop up saying "results saved"
- if there's an idea you have for a project code but don't know how to code it, there might be a library

-- popular libraries are usually flexible, aka read by most browsers, version control... but LOOK @ DOCS and updates/upgrades

- Library vs Framework
- similar and there are disagreements in the tech industry about how they're different
- library set of reusuable code
- framework might have more rules about how it should be used; more complicated more processing part



// Virtual DOM
DOM = document object model
Virtual, the dom copied and in the memory
helpful cause of computing and loading time, processing
On the backend

Without the Virtual DOM -->
If we change one thing, its going to reload the whoooole page -- bad for bigger projects, lots of things changing all the time

Virtual DOM --> (does it automatically in React);
Takes a copy/snapshot, see whats changed and compare to previous state, then it will target that corresponding element and that is what it will update --> saves us from lots of updates and it makes it fast and lighter.... it's just stored in memory; things need to be
